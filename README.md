# Reinforcement Learning for Robust Low-Thrust Interplanetary Trajectory Design

This code implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to deal with the robust design of mass-optimal, time-fixed, low-thrust interplanetary transfers
with fixed initial and final conditions. Specifically, the mission can be an interception (fixed final position), or a rendezvous (fixed final position and velocity).
The Sims-Flanagan method is used to model the low-thrust trajectory, that is divided into a number of segments. Two different thrust models are implemented:
1. impulsive thrust, with the magnitude of any impulse limited by the amount of velocity variation that could be accumulated over the duration of the corresponding segment;
2. piecewise constant thrust.

The environment can be deterministic or stochastic (i.e., with state, observation and/or control uncertainties, as well as with a single or multiple consecutive missed thrust events).

The program is based on [Stable Baselines](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/), an open-source library containing a set of improved implementations of RL algorithms based on [OpenAI Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines).
All necessary information can be found in the corresponding GitHub repository.

Moreover, the program uses [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) message passing interface implementation to run different environment realizations in parallel on several CPU cores during training.

## Installation

To correctly set up the code on Linux (Ubuntu), please follow the present instructions:

1. Check if your Python environment is already configured, with:
    ```
    $ python3 --version
    $ pip3 --version
    ```
    If these packages are already installed, skip to the next step. Otherwise, install Python 3, the pip package manager, and venv with:
    ```
    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip python3-venv
    ```
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended) with pip:
    ```
    $ python3 -m venv --system-site-packages ./venv
    ```
    and activate the environment:
    ```
    $ source ./venv/bin/activate
    ```
    When the virtual environment is active, your shell prompt is prefixed with (venv).

3. Install all required packages in the virtual environment by using the requirement file in the current repository:

    ```
    (venv)$ cd /path-to-cloned-GitHub-repository/RobustTrajectoryDesignbyRL/
    (venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Now, you can verify that all packages were successfully compiled and installed by running the following command:

```
(venv)$ python main_lowthrust_validate.py
```
If this command executes without any error, then your RobustTrajectoryDesignbyRL installation is ready for use.

Eventually, a LaTeX distribution should be installed on the computer in order to correctly visualize all graphs and plots. As an example, to install [Tex Live LaTeX](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) distribution on Ubuntu use the following command.
```
$ sudo apt-get install texlive-full
```

## User Guide

The program is composed by 3 main Python scripts (`main_lowthrust_(...).py`), the RL environment (in `gym-lowthrust/`), created by using the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) toolkit, and a number of additional Python modules (in `custom_modules/`) with useful functions.

Specifically:

1. `main_lowthrust_input.py` is the main file, that must   be called to train the agent in a specific RL environment. All the environment and program settings must be included in an external text file with ad-hoc formatting, to be placed in folder `settings_files/` and given as input to the script.
For example, to start training the agent with the settings specified in file `settings_files/settings.txt`, use the following command:
    ```
    (venv)$ main_lowthrust_input.py --settings settings.txt
    ```
    The information that must be contained in the settings file includes the RL algorithm used for training (`algorithm`) (among PPO, A2C, DDPG, SAC, TD3 and TRPO), the type of Deep Neural Network and its architecture (`policy`), the value of a number of algorithm-specific hyper-parameters, and some characteristic of the environment itself (such as the type of mission, thrust model, uncertainty source, standard deviations, and so on).
    The settings files that are already present in folder `settings_files/` are those used to obtain the results presented in paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08501, and can be used as a guide to prepare new files from scratch. The order in which the different input are written in the file is not important.

    The specific low-thrust mission to study (i.e., the initial and final conditions of the spacecraft and the total mission time) must be specified in a file to be placed in folder `missions/`. For example, file `Earth_Mars.dat` contains the spacecraft state an any time, obtained with an indirect optimization method, for the Earth-Mars rendezvous mission used as case study in paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08501.

    It is also possible to re-train with the same or different settings a pretrained RL model. In this case,
   the pretrained model file, e.g. `model.zip`, must be placed in `settings_files/` folder, and the program called with command:
    ```
    (venv)$ main_lowthrust_input.py --settings settings.txt --input_model model
    ```

    At the end of the training, the RL model and all output files are saved in directory `sol_saved/sol_(i)/`, where number (i) depends on how many solutions are already contained in this folder.
    The model corresponding to the policy trained in the unperturbed environment of paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08501 can be found in directory `sol_saved/sol_1/`.

2. `main_lowthrust_load.py` is the file that allows generating the plots of the robust trajectory and of the control that corresponds to a given model (policy).
Let us suppose that we want to realize the plots for the model saved in folder `sol_saved/sol_1/`. It is sufficient to run the command:
    ```
    (venv)$ main_lowthrust_load.py --settings sol_saved/sol_1/settings.txt --n_sol 1
    ```
    The graphs are saved in the same directory.
3. `main_lowthrust_MC.py` is the file that allows performing a Monte Carlo simulation of a given policy in a stochastic environment.
Let us suppose that we want to realize a MC by using the model saved in folder `sol_saved/sol_1/`. It is sufficient to run the command:
    ```
    (venv)$ main_lowthrust_MC.py --settings sol_saved/sol_1/settings.txt --n_sol 1
    ```
    The graphs and output files are saved in the same directory.


Enjoy the code!
